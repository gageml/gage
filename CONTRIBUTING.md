# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
  mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or
  political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
garrett@placeon.earth.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security
of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of
this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior
deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation
of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be
requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of
time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as
external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No
public or private interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is
allowed during this period.  Violating these terms may lead to a
permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction
within the community.

## Contribution Policy

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

### 1. Goals

1. To maximize the scale and diversity of the community around a
   project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a
   scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;

2. To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different
   skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any
   required domain;

3. To allow the project to develop faster and more successfully, by
   increasing the diversity of the decision making process;

4. To support the natural life cycle of project versions from
   experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation,
   rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;

5. To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus
   making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the
   scope for error;

6. To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases
   economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by
   hostile entities.

### 2. Design

#### 2.1. Preliminaries

1. The project SHALL use the Git distributed revision control system.

2. The project SHALL be hosted on github.com or equivalent, herein
   called the “Platform”.

3. The project SHALL use the Platform issue tracker.

4. The project SHALL have clearly documented guidelines for code style.

5. A “Contributor” is a person who wishes to provide a patch, being a
   set of commits that solve some clearly identified problem.

6. A “Maintainer” is a person who merges patches to the
   project. Maintainers are not developers; their job is to enforce
   process.

7. Contributors SHALL NOT have commit access to the repository unless
   they are also Maintainers.

8. Maintainers SHALL have commit access to the repository.

9. Everyone, without distinction or discrimination, SHALL have an
   equal right to become a Contributor under the terms of this
   contract.

#### 2.2. Licensing and Ownership

1. The project SHALL use the [Apache 2 open source
   license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which is
   specified in `LICENSE.txt`

2. All contributions to the project source code (“patches”) SHALL use
   the same license as the project.

3. All patches are owned by their authors. There SHALL NOT be any
   copyright assignment process.

4. Each Contributor SHALL be responsible for identifying themselves in
   the project Contributor list `AUTHORS.md` by providing the
   appropriate patch.

#### 2.3. Patch Requirements

1. Maintainers and Contributors MUST have a Platform account and
   SHOULD use their real names or a well-known alias.

2. A patch SHOULD be a minimal and effective answer to exactly one
   identified and agreed problem.

3. A patch SHOULD adhere to the code style guidelines of the project as
   defined in `STYLE.md`. Patches that do not adhere to the style
   guidelines SHOULD be rewritten to apply the defined style. A patch
   that does not adhere to the style guidelines SHALL NOT be rejected on
   that basis alone.

4. A patch SHOULD adhere to the “Evolution of Public Contracts”
   guidelines defined below.

5. A patch MAY include code from other projects even when the
   Contributor is not the original author of that code provided the use
   of the code is granted under a license listed in "Compatible
   Licenses" below. In such cases, attribution MUST be provided in the
   applicable project files.

6. A patch SHOULD compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at
   least the principal target platform. If a patch fails tests,
   Contributors or Maintainers MUST apply additional patches to fix
   failing tests in a timely manner. If tests are not fixed in a timely
   manner, the patch MUST be reverted and re-applied at a later time
   with passing tests.

7. A patch commit message MUST consist of a single short (less than 50
   characters) line stating the problem being solved, followed by a
   blank line and then the proposed solution.

#### 2.4. Development Process

1. Change on the project SHALL be governed by the pattern of
   identifying problems and applying minimal, effective solutions to
   these problems.

2. To request a change, a user SHOULD log an issue on the project
   Platform issue tracker.

3. The user or Contributor SHOULD write the issue by describing the
   problem they face or observe.

4. The user or Contributor SHOULD seek consensus on the applicability of
   their observation to the project and the value of solving the
   problem.

5. To work on an issue, a Contributor SHALL fork the project repository
   and then work on their forked repository.

6. To submit a patch, a Contributor SHALL create a Platform pull
   request back to the project.

7. A Contributor SHALL NOT commit changes directly to the project.

8. To discuss a patch, people MAY comment on the Platform pull request,
   on the commit, or elsewhere.

9. To accept or reject a patch, a Maintainer SHALL use the Platform
   interface.

10. Maintainers MAY merge their own patches.

11. Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors
    in a timely manner.

12. Maintainers MAY merge incorrect patches from other Contributors with
    the goals of capturing the patch in the historical record and
    engaging with the Contributor on improving the patch quality.

13. The user who created an issue SHOULD close the issue after
    checking the patch is successful.

14. Maintainers SHOULD close user issues that are left open without
    action and when no further action is expected. Closing such issues
    SHALL be accompanied by a comment explaining why the issue was
    closed.

#### 2.5. Branches and Releases

1. The project SHALL have one branch (“main”) that always holds the
   latest in-progress version and SHOULD always build.

2. The project SHALL NOT use topic branches for any reason. Personal
   forks MAY use topic branches.

3. To make a stable release a Maintainer shall tag the repository.
   Stable releases SHALL always be released from the main branch.

#### 2.6. Evolution of Public Contracts

1. All Public Contracts (APIs or protocols) SHALL be documented.

2. All Public Contracts SHOULD have space for extensibility and
   experimentation.

3. A patch that modifies a stable Public Contract SHOULD not break
   existing applications unless there is overriding consensus on the
   value of doing this.

4. A patch that introduces new features SHOULD do so using new names
   (a new contract).

5. New contracts SHOULD be marked as “draft” until they are stable and
   used by real users.

6. Old contracts SHOULD be deprecated in a systematic fashion by marking
   them as “deprecated” and replacing them with new contracts as needed.

7. When sufficient time has passed, old deprecated contracts SHOULD be
   removed.

8. Old names SHALL NOT be reused by new contracts.

#### 2.7. Project Administration

1. The project founders SHALL act as Administrators to manage the set of
   project Maintainers.

2. The Administrators SHALL ensure their own succession over time by
   promoting the most effective Maintainers.

3. A new Contributor who makes correct patches, who clearly understands
   the project goals, and the process SHOULD be invited to become a
   Maintainer.

4. Administrators SHOULD remove Maintainers who are inactive for an
   extended period of time, or who repeatedly fail to apply this process
   effectively.

5. Administrators SHOULD block or ban “bad actors” who cause stress and
   pain to others in the project. This should be done after public
   discussion, with a chance for all parties to speak. A bad actor is
   someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project,
   who is needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and
   who is unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by
   others.
