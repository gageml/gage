# Changes

### v0.1.2 (under development)

Fixes:

- Missing help topics

### v0.1.1

This is the first early release of Gage. The tool is still under
active development and docs are minimal.

For help:

- `gage help` or `gage <command> -h` - this is pretty decent
- Visit https://www.gage.chat - questions are encouraged
